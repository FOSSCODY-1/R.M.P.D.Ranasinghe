# Graph Implementation with BFS and DFS

Implementation of directed and undirected graphs with following functionalities <br />
	* Adding a new vertex <br />
	* Adding a new edge <br />
	* Displaying a vertex <br />
	* Deleting a vertex <br />
	* Deleting an edge <br />
	* Breadth First Search (BFS) <br />
	* Depth First Search (DFS) 


## Running the program

Download the [Graph_Implementation.jar](Graph_Implementation.jar) file and double click to open it. Then it will open like this.
